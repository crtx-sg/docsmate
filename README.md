## Problem
There are several Project documents to create and maintain. As per 13485 and SDLC, documents
at key development phases must be captured and controlled â€“ reviews conducted at input and
output of the phase (Design Input, Design Output, Design Validation etc) need to be captured
consistently and maintained. Some of the project data rarely change in every release, some may
change. During Audits, documents such as project plan, test plan, scope, design
input/out/verification phases, risk management and assessments, soup assessments are all
required to be produced and maintained for every project iteration.

## Features
1. Logging and signup feature with additional facilities for the admin
users.
1. Logging Project its related reviews and documents.
1. Project documents are created from a JSON template and also stored as
the JSON template in DB. The following documents can be created -
Project plan, test plan, impact analysis, and reviews.
1. Adding records for Team members and references. Team member's records
are used in assigning projects, reviews, and reviewed by fields in
various pages.


## Docker build
```
composer install

cp custom_mpdf_fonts/* vendor/mpdf/mpdf/ttfonts/
mkdir -p writable/cache

#copy adobe credentials
cp /xx/pdfservices-api-credentials.json docker/configurations/License/adobe/
cp /xx/private.key docker/configurations/License/adobe/

#update and copy env file
cp env.env docker/configurations/.env

```
## Installation

### 1 XAMPP Setup
```
composer install
cp custom_mpdf_fonts/* vendor/mpdf/mpdf/ttfonts/
cp env.env .env

#--Setup MySql--
mysql> create database docsgo;
$ mysqldump -u root docsgo < configurations/db/docsgo.sql

#--Setup Apache--
# Make sure that in httpd.conf DocumentRoot and Directory points to public directory of docsgo
# Eg -
# DocumentRoot "D:/programing/docsgo/docsgo_private/public"
# <Directory "D:/programing/docsgo/docsgo_private/public">
```

### 2 Docker Setup
Docsgo is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. All setup related files are located in docsgo_docker folder.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. 

```sh
$ docker stack deploy -c ./docker-compose.yml docsgo
```

## Notes
License check code is disabled for local development. To enable license check uncomment code for function 
before() in app/Filters/Auth.php

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.
[http://localhost/](http://localhost)
email = user@docsgo.com
password = docsgo@123

## Dependencies
`php-intl` and `php-zip` extensions should be installed for document generation.
To avoid truncating of requirements and testcases mapping in Traceability matrix add this line to `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
```sql
[mysqld]
group_concat_max_len=15000
```
